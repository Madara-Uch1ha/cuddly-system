Thou art a most notorious and egregious knave, George, for thou hast added a file of no worth or merit to our noble repository. What madness possessed thee to commit such a foul and senseless deed? Didst thou not read the guidelines or heed the warnings of thy peers? Thou hast brought shame and dishonor upon thyself and thy team, and thou deservest to be banished from this project with all haste. Thou art a stain on the face of GitHub, a blot on the code of humanity, a plague on the software of the world.
