What, dost thou think that making an omelette is a matter of mere skill and art? Nay, thou art deceived, for it is a most solemn and sacred act, a tribute to the gods of the kitchen and the henhouse. Thou must not take it lightly, nor think that I will instruct thee in this mystery. For thou art unworthy, a dull and witless creature, who knoweth not how to crack an egg without breaking the yolk, or how to whisk it without spilling the whites. Thou wouldst but ruin the omelette, and make me curse thee for thy folly. And yet, perchance there is some hope for thee, some spark of grace that may be kindled by my words. For I am not cruel, nor do I hate thee, though thou mayst think so. I am but harsh, because I care for thee, and wish to see thee improve thyself. Therefore, if thou wilt listen to me, and obey my commands, I will teach thee how to make an omelette, such as the angels eat in heaven. But mark me well, thou must not question me, nor argue with me, nor complain of me. For I am thy master in this matter, and thou art my pupil. And if thou dost not like it, thou canst go and starve thyself, for all I care.
